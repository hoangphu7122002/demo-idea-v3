const PLAN_RULES = `Goal: a short ROADMAP, not a build plan. Do not write code, tasks or schedules; the user plans each feature later together with pr-team.
Read specs/spec.md, ${RUN}/scope/demo.md, ${RUN}/scope/cut.md, ${RUN}/scope/features.md, the brief ${A.brief || 'none'} and, if present, the target repo's CLAUDE.md (${A.repo || 'none given'}).
The roadmap must make clear: which features exist (as many as the scope needs), what each depends on, and which can be built in parallel. Keep it brief; link to spec.md AC ids instead of repeating detail.
Format (SKILL.md and pr-team rely on it):
- One section per feature headed \`## F<n> · <name>\` (n = 1, 2, ...), each with: Status (⬜/✅), Depends on (F ids or none), AC ids, one-line goal.
- A Mermaid dependency graph of the F ids.
- A waves table: Wave | Features (features in one wave have no dependency on each other and can run in parallel).
FULL PRODUCT ROADMAP (mandatory): the roadmap lists EVERY feature of the brief's "Full feature map" (all groups: Platform, Authoring, Reading, Community, Moderation, New-finding service, Sharing, Seed data) plus anything in features.md, each as its own F<n>. Build, Fake AND Later items from cut.md are all roadmap features; nothing is dropped. Each feature also gets a Milestone line: M1 (demo milestone = cut.md Build items + what the demo path needs, before code freeze) or M2+/Later. Add a "Milestones" section: M1 = the demo (list its F ids, link demo.md), then later milestones. Group sections by brief group. Features outside M1 may have no AC ids yet: write "AC: TBD (plan with pr-team)".`
